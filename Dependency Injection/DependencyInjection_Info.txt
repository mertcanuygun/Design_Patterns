--Dependency Injection Design Pattern

-This pattern is used for minimizing the dependency between classes by using interface. This way, the project will be resillient for modifications.

In the example, Playlist classes and the LaMusica class are connected each other with an abstract structure which allows us to call playlists via IPlaylist.
